## Core (Now)
- [ ] dynamic markdown editor - implement proper editor

## Feature (Later)
- [ ] implement search
- [ ] add photo, image, video notes (as upload) (follow obsidian markdown embed syntax)

## Polish (Last)
- [ ] implement dynamic refresh of files like a (good) file manager (maybe)
- [ ] improve interface for homescreen, too much padding under each note and folder card, improve folder look, make color choosable.
- [ ] improve implementation of Widget _buildVaultStats (the pill) to do less function calling if easy enough
- [ ] consider making the change vault location not alter the app's idea of what locations it has access to (persistent permissions in app state to reflect permissions for the OS) or delete app data about permissions and instead query for it every time
- [ ] show the old folder tree on the side on rightward swipe?
- [ ] quick settings panel quick note
- [ ] update versions of all the libraries
- [ ] fix padding for notes panel
- [ ] remove timestamp on the note cards in the homescreen
- [ ] fix yaml behavior - 'Notes with YAML will have it deleted when they are edited.''The app\'s yaml frontmatter will be added again if it is turned on and edited again'
