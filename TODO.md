- [ ] vault_setup_screen ln 32: see if it is possible to make this work for iOS, since I think this path will break iOS
- [ ] ~~make the status bar (that shows folder name, count, and note count below the location and search) hidable (requires editing settings and directory_screen I think)~~
- [ ] assess whether to have have photo, image, video permissions in my AndroidManifest.xml
- [ ] get rid of all app state (to do with notes)
- [ ] dynamic markdown editor - implement proper editor
- [ ] implement search
- [ ] improve implementation of Widget _buildVaultStats (the pill) to do less function calling if easy enough
- [ ] implement dynamic refresh of files like a (good) file manager (maybe)
- [ ] improve interface for homescreen, too much padding under each note and folder card, improve folder look, make color choosable.
