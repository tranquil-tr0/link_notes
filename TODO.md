## Core (Now)
- [ ] get rid of all app state (to do with notes)
- [ ] dynamic markdown editor - implement proper editor

## Feature (Later)
- [ ] implement search
- [ ] add photo, image, video notes (as upload) (follow obsidian markdown embed syntax)

## Polish (Last)
- [ ] implement dynamic refresh of files like a (good) file manager (maybe)
- [ ] improve interface for homescreen, too much padding under each note and folder card, improve folder look, make color choosable.
- [ ] improve implementation of Widget _buildVaultStats (the pill) to do less function calling if easy enough
